 Today was a pink mountain. First, I got the package I was expecting months ago, opened the box and it was just what I wanted. But then I saw Ana's message and she told me that she was very tired and dead. I wrote something but I felt that the words were not enough, you know? And at night I heard something in the garden. I thought it was a drone. I grabbed the bucket and... no, it was a patch revolving the garbage. And my dad asked me to get up this afternoon again. I almost cried. I'm not a robber, I said. To kill myself, I tried a new smoothie. You know, it was horrible. I spit it out at the moment. I wouldn't drink it again. Anyway, good morning. I need a normal day. Please.
